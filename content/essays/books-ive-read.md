### Building Wealth One House At A Time

So much practical information on real estate investing and managing tenants. Fantastic advice on negotiation and finding deals.

 

### Millionaire Next Door

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

A book on a study of millionaires and their spending habits. Pretty much every millionaire drives an old or inexpensive car and has take home pay of $150,000 - $100,000 or less. Frugality is the name of the millionaire game. Four stars because book was somewhat clinical in nature due to the study but still fascinating look at their habits.

 

### Richest Man in Babylon

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Read: August 2015

Brilliant classic that teaches financial advise through a series of fables; this should be required reading for every person. Very short read and was published in early-1900s so very inexpensive.

 

### Your Money or Your Life

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ 1/2

Eye-opening look at how to place value on your life using real equations and how much income you really take home after expenses. One couple saved thousands per year when one of them quit their job and took care of their child instead of day care, fancy clothes, vehicle expenses, et cetera. Great book on learning to see how your job is destroying your soul but a bit redundant in later chapters, hence the rating.

 

### Salt: A World History

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

A look at the importance of salt in world history, including serving as the root of the word 'salary' because it was used as a payment method. Great read as it encompasses so many human events throughout history and it is strange how salt played such a role.
