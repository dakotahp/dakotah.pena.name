# Fixed Wheel Bike

Setting out to design a bike from scratch, I started with a raw steel frame.

Designed piece-by-piece. One gear, one brake.

Parts:

Mission Bicycles frame
Velo Orange handle bar
Brooks B-17 saddle
Bianchi stem
Shimano Ultegra brake
Weimann wheels
Veloflex Record tyres
MKS pedals
Sugino crankset
