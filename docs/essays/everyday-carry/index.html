<p>I like to think of the EDC (everyday carry) concept as prepping light. It‚Äôs the first small step towards being prepared for different situations.</p>

<p>There are endless forums for seeing people‚Äôs kit and this essay is no different, albeit maybe with a little more context.</p>

<p>My kit is in a constant state of flux so this will be updated as changes are made.</p>

<h2 id="on-my-person">On my person</h2>

<h3 id="pistol">Pistol</h3>

<p>I have no intention of leaving my own and my family‚Äôs lives up to chance in this day and age. Thus, carrying a firearm evens the fight in situations where criminals try to break the social contract.</p>

<ul>
<li>Walther 9mm PPS-MQ 2 (Usually in warmer months)</li>
<li>Sig Sauer .357 SIG (Worn in winter due to it‚Äôs bulk)</li>
<li>Glock 20 10mm (Worn on hikes as hard-cast 10mm can be sufficient enough for Greenland Rangers to stop polar bear)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="maxpedition-pocket-carry">Maxpedition Pocket Carry</h3>

<p>This little pocket pouch is a good solution to the problem when you‚Äôre leaving the house and having to cull all the things you need to carry in your pockets. Many of which, in my case, may not be in the same place.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not quite as small as it looks which can be good and bad. Stuff it with things and it will only be suitable for cargo pockets. Otherwise just keeping a small amount of the bare essentials allows it to slip into a pocket without it making it look like you‚Äôre robbing a bank of  their quarters.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kershaw tanto blade knife</li>
<li>Zebra Z-01F</li>
<li>Lip balm</li>
<li>Band-Aids</li>
<li>Nail clippers</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="want-essentials-de-la-vie-wallet">WANT Essentials de la Vie wallet</h3>

<p>This wallet isn‚Äôt any kind of life hack sort of thing, it was bought purely for fashion purposes. It‚Äôs not the kind of wallet that goes in a back pocket which is what I like about it. Zipping up securely is a feature I prefer in a wallet than folding varieties.</p>

<h3 id="keys">Keys</h3>

<h4 id="freekey-keyring">FreeKey keyring</h4>

<ul>
<li>Pry bar</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="remove-before-flight-tag">Remove Before Flight tag</h4>

<h4 id="olight-aaa-flashlight">Olight AAA flashlight</h4>

<p>This was free with another flash light and is surprisingly great The brightness is shocking for it‚Äôs size and plenty for situations where you need a quick splash of light such as walking to your car at night.</p>

<h2 id="weekday-bag">Weekday Bag</h2>

<h2 id="weekend-bag">Weekend Bag</h2>

<h3 id="porter-heat-waist-sling-bag">Porter Heat waist/sling bag</h3>

<p>Keeping a backpack with more kit in my vehicle, what I end up wearing on my person for the weekend is this cross body bag. It‚Äôs from the Japanese luxury brand Head Porter and was bought on eBay due to poor selection of Porter in the US. (Technically this is a bum/fanny pack style bag but the Japanese and I only wear them cross-body.)</p>

<p>It features a main pocket which is a lot smaller than it looks so it forces me to fill it with just enough that I‚Äôd want to be with me at all times.</p>
