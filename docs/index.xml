      <title>Everyday Carry</title>

      <description>I like to think of the EDC (everyday carry) concept as prepping light. It’s the first small step towards being prepared for different situations.
There are endless forums for seeing people’s kit and this essay is no different, albeit maybe with a little more context.
My kit is in a constant state of flux so this will be updated as changes are made.
On my person Pistol I have no intention of leaving my own and my family’s lives up to chance in this day and age.</description>

      <title>Always Carry Perfect Change</title>
      <link>https://dakotah.pena.name/essays/perfect-change/</link>

      <description>People pay with cash less and less these days, particularly with change. Transactions under about twenty dollars are sometimes worth paying in cash to me. Because the finality of the transaction is so nice sometimes. Additionally, small local businesses prefer cash because it&#39;s harder to absorb the merchant fee.
    I often just hand over the most efficient bank note and put the change in a container for a future CoinStar trip.</description>
