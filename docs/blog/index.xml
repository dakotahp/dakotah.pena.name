      <description>We had a great turnout for July. Several new folks showed up from different tech related industries like home automation.
How to Find The Group I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if everybody who RSVPed was in attendance and I apologize if you missed the notification of where to find us. I had sent out a notification to those that were planning to attend around 2pm and then a couple more people RSVPed and didn&amp;rsquo;t get the notification.</description>
