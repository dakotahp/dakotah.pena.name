This means you will be creating less marketable data for these companies and likely saving money in the process.
The shutdown of Google Reader years ago sent ripples across the internet as there was now room for competition in the form of small, paid feed reading services like Feedbin.</description></item><item><title>Human Fund Card</title><link>https://dakotahpena.studio/work/human-fund-card/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2019 06:55:14 -0800</pubDate><author>hey@dakotahpena.studio (Dakotah)</author><guid>https://dakotahpena.studio/work/human-fund-card/</guid><description>A donation has been made in your name to The Human Fund.

It’s the first small step towards being prepared for different situations.

Because the carriers could price different modes of communication, be it voice, data, SMS, differently it means they could adjust their profits over time as usage of these different channels shifted so they could stay ahead of any curve.
The argument for a data-only provider is that all communication can be transmitted over data and we can have one single method of communicating on a mobile phone and thereby turning providers into dumb pipes like a cable internet connection.</description></item><item><title>Always Carry Perfect Change</title><link>https://dakotahpena.studio/essays/perfect-change/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hey@dakotahpena.studio (Dakotah)</author><guid>https://dakotahpena.studio/essays/perfect-change/</guid><description>People pay with cash less and less these days, particularly with change.
