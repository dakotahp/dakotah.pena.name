<p>Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p>Read: October 2018</p>
<p>Stories about people who have used financial constraints as tools to build huge businesses. Written by FUBU creator Daymond John, the premise of all the examples is that having too much starting capital can be a bad thing. Great lessons to always keep in mind.</p>
<h3 id="the-compound-effect">The Compound Effect</h3>
<p>Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p>How to change your life a tiny percentage at a time to get huge gains later in life. Short, succinct book clearly explains this process and how making small changes to build momentum and good habits is the only real way for self improvement.</p>
<h3 id="the-millionaire-real-estate-investor">The Millionaire Real Estate Investor</h3>
<p>Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p>Read: January 2016</p>
<p>Good lifecycle explanation of what separates novice investors from the best investors. Contains many critical concepts such as keeping your properties at a certain debt-to-equity ratio for maximum growth and how little properties you need to acquire to really make a million annually with different scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="currency-wars-the-making-of-the-next-global-crisis">Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis</h3>
<p>Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ 1/2</p>
<p>Read: December 2015</p>
<h3 id="building-wealth-one-house-at-a-time">Building Wealth One House At A Time</h3>
<p>Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Read: November 2015</p>
<p>So much practical information on real estate investing and managing tenants. Fantastic advice on negotiation and finding deals.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="millionaire-next-door">Millionaire Next Door</h3>
<p>Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p>A book on a study of millionaires and their spending habits. Pretty much every millionaire drives an old or inexpensive car and has take home pay of $150,000 - $100,000 or less. Frugality is the name of the millionaire game. Four stars because book was somewhat clinical in nature due to the study but still fascinating look at their habits.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="richest-man-in-babylon">Richest Man in Babylon</h3>
<p>Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p>Read: August 2015</p>
<p>Brilliant classic that teaches financial advise through a series of fables; this should be required reading for every person. Very short read and was published in early-1900s so very inexpensive.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="your-money-or-your-life">Your Money or Your Life</h3>
<p>Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ 1/2</p>
<p>Eye-opening look at how to place value on your life using real equations and how much income you really take home after expenses. One couple saved thousands per year when one of them quit their job and took care of their child instead of day care, fancy clothes, vehicle expenses, et cetera. Great book on learning to see how your job is destroying your soul but a bit redundant in later chapters, hence the rating.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="salt-a-world-history">Salt: A World History</h3>
<p>Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p>A look at the importance of salt in world history, including serving as the root of the word &lsquo;salary&rsquo; because it was used as a payment method. Great read as it encompasses so many human events throughout history and it is strange how salt played such a role.</p>
