      <description>I like to think of the EDC (everyday carry) concept as prepping light. It’s the first small step towards being prepared for different situations.
There are endless forums for seeing people’s kit but this page aims to give some context to the decision making behind the items rather than just a consumerist show off. My kit is in a constant state of flux the page will be updated as changes are made.</description>
